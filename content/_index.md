Welcome to my website! I am now a research assistant at [Stanley Ho Big Data Decision Analytics Research Centre](https://www.bdda.cuhk.edu.hk/) of [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). Under the supervision of [Prof Thomas YT Lam](https://www.nur.cuhk.edu.hk/people/professoriate-academic-staff/professor-lam-yuen-tung-thomas/), I conduct applied research on gastroenterology, cancer screening and AI for medicine. 

My research interests focus on modelling dynamic human systems, dynamic non-human systems and their various interactions. I look forward to applying state-of-the-art statistical methods into evidence-based public health research. 

Prior to my stay in Hong Kong, I completed a MSc in Statistics and Data Science at [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html), a MSc Earthquake Engineering with Disaster Management at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and a BEng Civil Engineering at [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), and conducted research at [Water Equity Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/allaire/) of [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof Maura Allaire](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/allaire/).
